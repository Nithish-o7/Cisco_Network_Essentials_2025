This next step involves enhancing the parser to understand the routing logic. Your program will now not only see that routers are connected but will begin to understand how they decide to send traffic.

I will update your network_analyzer.py script with the new code to handle OSPF configurations.

-------------

# How to Execute This Code

## Update Your Python Script:

Open network_analyzer.py and replace the existing code with the new code from the document above. The core change is an update to the parse_cisco_config function to make it "OSPF-aware."

-------------

## Update Your Configuration Files:

Your program can now read OSPF settings, but your .txt files don't have any yet! You must add OSPF configuration to R1.txt, R2.txt, and R3.txt.

## Run the Script:

Open your terminal, navigate to your project folder.

Run the script: python network_analyzer.py

## Expected Output:

The terminal output will now have a new section verifying the OSPF data it found. The graph visualization will pop up as before.
